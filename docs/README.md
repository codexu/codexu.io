## Introduction

X-BUILD is a scaffolding tool for small projects. It can quickly initialize the project directory in a few seconds through terminal commands, and solve the problems of automation, performance, modularity, specification, adaptive layout, etc. in development, and help you generate better code. . It consists of two parts: a project generator based on the Node.js environment, which is an NPM package installed in the global environment, and a webpack-based development and production environment that configures various requirements.

## Features

**scaffold:**

- Automatic creation of project directory (custom / fast)

- Automatically install dependencies / auto-initialize Git

- Generate profiles for more flexible options

**Development / Production Environment:**

- webpack4 based development environment

- Support for CSS preprocessors (sass, less, stylus)

- Support for TypeScript & TSLint or Babel & ESLint

- Provide an optional adaptive solution

- Data interface module is automatically loaded

## Suitable for the environment

- **Small projects**: Short cycle, no need to use large framework development and guarantee the quality and efficiency of the project.

- **Efficient learning**: Whether it is ES new syntax, TS or CSS preprocessor, avoid complex construction environment affecting learning efficiency.

::: danger Building a large project
If you have enough knowledge of X-BUILD and master webpack, you can build an environment suitable for large-scale project development, but I don't recommend it!
